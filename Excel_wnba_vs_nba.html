							<h2>PART 3: FILTERING, CENTRAL TENDENCY, & DISPERSION CALCULATIONS</h2>

						<p>
							In this section, filter options are used on the main NBA table in order to look at interesting subgroups of players and do Central Tendency and Dispersion calculations. Each filtered tables are copy and pasted into their own individual worksheets.
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>NOTE:</b> For the simplistic scope of this project, those who did not play during the 2019-2020 season have blanks in their game statistics. For further computations, Excel will ignore the blanks. This will skew the data a bit, especially because big players like Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant will not be included in the data set. Additionally, players like Stephen Curry were injured this season and have irregular game statistics. These issues will lead to data not being fully accurately captured, but for a simple snapshot, it gives a general overview of the league.

The middle salary amount has increased when looking at comparative years of WNBA experience—for example, veterans with 5 years of experience in 2021 received a $48,700 increase in median salary compared to veterans with 5 years of experience in 2020. However, there is not a clear pattern of increased years of experience affecting the median salary amounts.</br>

For example, veterans who have played for 5 years professionally have a $3,527,500 gap on median salary for the WNBA 2020/NBA 2019-2020 seasons and an $4,559,516 gap on median salary for the WNBA 2021/NBA 2020-2021 seasons between the two leagues. The gap between the two leagues is smaller for the median salaries than average salaries (which can also be attributed to the median not being driven by outliers like the average is).

Veteran centers during the 19-20 season have a smaller range of low salaries and have a majority of the salaries clustered at the top compared to the other positions. In the 20-21 season, multiple players with high salaries had their salaries drastically cut because of injury or other reasons (for example, DeMarcus Cousins received $3.5 million in 19-20 and only $200,000 in 20-21), which shifted the median down much more, as more players were clustered towards the bottom range of salaries.

This disparity is exemplified the most when comparing the maximum salaries between the two leagues—the greatest players of the WNBA make almost 200x less than the greatest players in the NBA do.

						<p>
							Just like in PPG and MPG, the average salaries of the players within the top 25% of GP increased between seasons for both leagues. The median salaries increased between seasons for the WNBA, but dropped slightly for the NBA. Again, this could suggest an increased number of players with salaries in the upper range for the WNBA. For the NBA, the reduced median could suggest an increase in the number of players with salaries toward the lower range, and the increased average could suggest larger salaries for those players in the higher range, compared to the previous season.</br>
							When comparing the players who contribute to and play the most games in their respective leagues, the NBA players continue to be paid much more than the WNBA players.

					<p>
						&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u><b>Average Salary by Experience:</b></u></br>
						&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>WNBA:</b> Average salary seems to have increased in 2021 from the 2020 season. Average salaries are fairly linear with more experience, but more years in the WNBA does not seem to lead to a significant increase in average salary.</br>
						&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>NBA:</b> Average salary seems to have decreased in 20-21 from the 19-20 season. There is a slight bell shaped curve to average salaries—the more years in the NBA, the higher the average salary until hitting a peak around 10-14 years, after which average salary decreases.</br>
						&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Between leagues:</b> There is a large disparity between the average NBA and the WNBA veteran salary amounts. For example, for veterans who have 5 years of professional experience, there is an $8,174,656.18 gap on average salary for the WNBA 2021/NBA 2020-2021 seasons between the two leagues.
					</p>

					<p>
						&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u><b>Median Salary by Experience:</b></u></br>
						&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>WNBA:</b> Across the two seasons, median salary amount has increased when looking at comparative years of WNBA experience. However, overall, there is not a clear pattern of increased years of experience affecting the median salary amounts.</br>
						&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>NBA:</b> Across the two seasons, median salary for veterans with 5-6 years of NBA experience seems to have increased from 19-20 to 20-21, median salary for veterans with 7-13 years of NBA experience seems to have decreased, and median salary for veterans with 15-17 years of experience seems to have stayed about the same amount. Overall, there is not a clear pattern of increased years of experience affecting the median salary amounts.</br>
						&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Between leagues:</b> Median salaries of the NBA veterans greatly outweigh the WNBA's. For example, veterans who have played for 5 years professionally have a $4,559,516 gap on median salary for the WNBA 2021/NBA 2020-2021 seasons between the two leagues. The gap between the two leagues is smaller for the median salaries than average salaries (which can also be attributed to the median not being driven by outliers like the average is).
					</p>

					<p>
						&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u><b>Average Salary by Position:</b></u></br>
						&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Across the different positions, there generally is not much spread of veteran average salaries—the WNBA has an average salary around $140,000 no matter the position and the NBA has an average salary around $11,000,000 no matter the position.</br>
						&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Between leagues:</b> NBA veterans receive an average salary of about $11 million more than WNBA veterans do.

						&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <u><b>Median Salary by Position:</b></u></br>
						&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>WNBA:</b> Generally, the median salaries for veterans are within around a $40,000 range between each of the positions.</br>
						&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>NBA:</b> The guard and forward positions have median salaries around $8 million, while the center position has more variation between the 19-20 and 20-21 seasons (between around $11 million to around $5 million). Veteran centers during the 19-20 season have a smaller range of low salaries and have a majority of the salaries clustered at the top compared to the other positions. In the 20-21 season, some players with high salaries had their salaries drastically cut because of injury or other reasons, which shifted the median down much more.</br>
						&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Between leagues:</b> NBA veteran guards receive a median salary of about $8 million more than WNBA veteran guards do. NBA veteran centers receive a median salary of about $5 million to $11 million more than WNBA veteran centers do. NBA veteran forwards receive a median salary of about $7 million more than WNBA veteran forwards do.

Average, median, and maximum salary amounts were calculated for the overall leagues, charts were made to compare the two leagues, and then further comparison was done for subgroups within: veterans, rookies, those players who were within the Top 25% of Points Per Game, players within the Top 25% of Minutes Per Game, and players within the Top 25% of Games Played. Within the veterans group, WNBA and NBA salaries were also compared across similar years experience levels and across similar player positions. Within the rookies group, comparisons were also done across similar player positions.
					</p>

					<p>
						No matter which subgroup was looked at, there was a clear discrepancy between the salaries that players within the WNBA and NBA receive—the NBA players received a great magnitude of larger salaries than their WNBA counterparts did. For rookies, the maximum salary in the NBA was $9,757,440.00 in 2020-2021, compared to the WNBA's maximum salary of $70,040.00 in 2021—a difference of $9,687,400. The median salary for rookies in the NBA was $1,988,500.00 in 2020-21, versus the WNBA's $61,543.00 in 2021—a gap of $1,926,957. For veterans and within the leagues overall, the maximum salary in the NBA was $43,006,362.00 in 2020-2021 and only $221,450.00 in 2021 for the WNBA—for a whopping $42,784,912.00 difference. The median salary for veterans was $7,316,666.50 in 2020-21 in the NBA and $167,500.00 in 2021 in the WNBA—a gap of $7,149,166.50. The median salary in the entire NBA was $3,095,432.00 in 2020-2021 and $110,000.00 in 2021 in the entire WNBA—a disparity of $2,985,432.00.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						Looking at comparative attributes of players (similar years experience, position played, and being in the top 25% of the league in Points Per Game, Minutes Per Game, and Games Played) across the two leagues, this disparity in pay continues. For rookies, players in the WNBA had a median of about $60,000 in 2021 no matter the position, whereas the NBA players had a median of about $1,000,000 to $2,000,000 in 2020-2021. For veterans, similar years of experience led to major gaps between the leagues—for example, veterans who played 5 years professionally had a median salary difference of $4,559,516 during the WNBA 2021/NBA 2020-2021 seasons. WNBA veteran athletes had a median salary of around $170,000 for each position in the 2021 season, compared to the NBA veteran atheletes that had around $5,000,000 to $7,000,000 for each position during the 2020-2021 season. For the players in the entirety of the leagues within the top 25% of Points Per Game during the WNBA 2020/NBA 2020-2021 seasons, there was a gap in median salary of about $4,808,000; for players with similar scoring output, the women are paid far less than their male counterparts for contributing the same percentage of points within their own league. Similarly, for players who played comparatively the same number of minutes and were within the top 25% of Minutes Per Game, there was a gap of median salary of about $4,502,840 for the WNBA 2021/NBA 2020-2021 seasons—NBA players are rewarded far more than the WNBA players are for similar minutes of playing time per game. Finally, for players within the top 25% of Games Played during the WNBA 2020/NBA 2020-2021 season, the difference in median salary was about $3,204,200—despite being just as important players as and having to play a similar high percentage of games as the NBA players do, the WNBA players continue to be paid much less.

					<p>
						The gender wage gap is not a phenomenon new or unique to professional basketball. According to the <a href="https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2021/demo/p60-273.pdf">United States Census Bureau</a>, in 2020, the median female-to-male earnings ratio was 0.830—women earned 83 cents to every dollar made by men. Furthermore, the wage gap widens when also accounting for race. Black and African American women—a large makeup of the league—have lower median incomes than non-Hispanic white women do. Despite putting in the same amount of effort and work, and having comparable contributions to their respective teams, professional women basketball athletes receive only a small percentage of what the men do. Veteran players have the most experience and tend to contribute the most to their teams. However, in the WNBA 2021/NBA 2020-2021 season, the highest paid WNBA veteran received a salary ($221,450) about 44 times less than the highest paid NBA rookie did ($9,757,440). The median salary for WNBA veterans ($167,500) was about 12 times less than what the median salary for NBA rookies ($1,988,500) was in the same seasons. To be a professional athlete means to be an incredibly skilled and high level performer in your sport. Add in the physicality and toll on one's body basketball does, the wages that the WNBA players receive are unaccetable.
					</p>

					<p>
						While there are numerous reasons and hurdles behind the lack of popularity towards women's sports, it is reasonable to acknowledge there most likely will never be the same amount of interest and financial success in the WNBA as there is in the NBA. To expect there to be complete parity in salaries and have the women making tens of millions of dollars is unrealistic. However, there can be improvements made to support the best women's basketball athletes and lessen these major salary disparities. There are already new contract deals that were signed to steadily increase salary amounts over time, increase the number of games shown on major TV networks, and provide bonuses and benefits to the players (including better travel accomodations and improved family planning options). However, if these salary amounts are not properly addressed going forward, we will continue to see the pattern we already have—WNBA players will spend their off-seasons on international teams, risking injury and sometimes personal safety, to <a href="https://queenballers.club/basketball/overseas-womens-basketball-salary">sometimes make more than a million dollars</a>.
					</p>
					
					
					<p>
						While the WNBA will most likely never reach the height of popularity the NBA enjoys and, therefore, will not have players receiving salaries as high as the NBA, these professional athletes deserve to be paid an appropriate rate to reflect their skills and hard work. Women's sports need to be supported and to do that, there needs to be increased positive media exposure and negotiations to increase pay so that some of the best athletes in the world are fairly compensated.
