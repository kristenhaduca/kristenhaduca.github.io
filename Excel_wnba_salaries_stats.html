							All of the individual team salary tables are merged into one main worksheet (WNBA Main) and a main salary table. All of the salaries are changed to currency format. Since the project is looking at 2020 and 2021 salaries, and Her Hoops Stats only has the salaries tables going back to 2021 at earliest, 2020 salary data is manually added from another page of <a href="https://herhoopstats.substack.com/p/updated-2020-wnba-rosters-and-salary">Her Hoop Stats</a> where there are additional images listing salary data for 2020. Excess columns with future years are removed.

						<p>
							The game statistics of interest (Games Played, Minutes Per Game, and Points Per Game) from the 2020 Statistics Table are appended to the Salary Table on the WNBA Main worksheet using <mark><b>INDEX()</b></mark> and <mark><b>MATCH()</b></mark> to index the statistics and match them by player name. These functions are nested within the <mark><b>IF()</b></mark> and <mark><b>ISERROR()</b></mark> functions to return a blank cell if there is an #N/A error after the INDEX()/MATCH()—this error being caused by no statistics information in the 2020 Statistics Table because of things such as the player having been in college or not playing during the 2020 season. The table containing both the salaries and statistics will now be referred to as the Full WNBA Table.

							</p>
						</p>

						<p>
							At this point, I noticed some discrepancies between the 2021 salaries on some players listed on the salaries page and on the 2020 statistics page of Her Hoops Stats. Working on the WNBA Main worksheet, I add a new column indexing the 2021 salaries listed per player on the 2020 Statistics Table using <mark><b>INDEX()</b></mark> and <mark><b>MATCH()</b></mark>.

							<h4>Adding Missing Data for Big Players</h4>
						</header>
						<p>
							Because the 2020 WNBA season took place inside the pandemic Bubble, many key players did not play due to health concerns. I acknowledge that mixing 2019 stats with 2020 stats would skew the data a bit (for example, certain players who are filling in for these players would have altered stats in 2020 that they wouldn't have in previous years due to limited playing time). While it would be best practice to use a comparison of 2018 and 2019 stats to give a more accurate picture of a normal season, for the sake of this project's scope and including the newer, evolving salary negotiations—in addition to there only being a handful of players (all important WNBA figures whose absence in this data would be remiss) who opted out—it was easiest to include their 2019 stats with the rest of the 2020 stats to give a general overlook.
						</p>
						<p>
							These players are included in the 2021 salary data, but have blanks within the 2020 statistics data. A new column containing an <mark><b>IF()</b></mark> statement is used to find those players that had a salary listed but no stats from 2020—and to differentiate them from the rookies coming out of college. If the Games Played column cell is blank and the 2020 Salary column cell is "College", then "College" will be listed. If the Games Played column cell is blank and the 2020 Salary column cell is a number (using <mark><b>ISNUMBER()</b></mark>), then "Blank" will be listed—the desired outcome for filtering those players who have salaries listed but no stats data. Otherwise, both salary and stats data is fully listed (or are listed as waived, suspended, or otherwise did not play and will not be looked at later in this project) and a 0 will be returned.

						In this section, regression analysis is run on two sections: Veterans and All WNBA Players. First, simple linear regressions are run for each game statistic to see the relationship between each individual statistic and salary. Then, multiple linear regression is run to find out which statistic is a better predictor of salary.

The Veterans table is copied to a new worksheet, sorted by smallest to largest, and the players with text or blanks are removed from the table. Initially, I had wanted to preserve these players for other potentially interesting comparisons of the league as a whole in the future. Because there are so few of these players with incompatible data and, again, for the sake of the simplistic scope of this project, it still gave a general overview of the relationships between the dependent and independent variables—even if it is not 100% accurate or fully consistent. I also ran the regression analysis (via <mark><b>LINEST()</b></mark>) between both the dataset containing these players with blanks and the dataset with them removed, and the small differences between the two did not seem significant enough to warrant concern.

						<h4>MULTIPLE LINEAR REGRESSIONS:</h4>
					</header>
					<p>
						To identify which game statistics are better predictors of salary, a correlation matrix between all the variables is created, and then multiple linear regression is run.
					</p>

					<header class="major">
						<h5>1. Correlation Matrix:</h5>
					</header>
					<p>
						A correlation matrix is created to show the linear correlation between each pair of variables and to identify any multicollinearity issues. The independent variables (game statistics) should have low correlations with each other and a high correlation with the dependent variable (salary). The correlation matrix is made using the Correlation option in the Data Analysis ToolPak.

						</a>
					</p>
					<p>
						The game stats do not have particularly high correlation with salary, with Points Per Game being the highest at 0.428. Minutes Per Game and Points Per Game have a high correlation with each other (if a player plays more minutes, they are more likely to also score more points), so it does not make much sense to include both of these variables. Because Minutes Per Game has the lowest correlation with salary, it will be dropped prior to running the regression.

						</a>
					</p>
					<p>
						Minutes Per Game and Points Per Game have a stronger correlation with salary in 2021, compared to 2020. Games Played continues to have a low correlation with salary. Minutes Per Game and Points Per Game also continue to have a high correlation with each other because we are taking these statistics as constant both years—Minutes Per Game is redundant and will be dropped again.

					<p>
						EXTRA DATA CLEANING NOTE: Like with the veterans, regression analysis via the Data Analysis tab gives an error for those with blank cells. To give a general overview of the data, the data set is copy and pasted into a new worksheet, and the data is cleaned to remove those players with any blanks. First, Conditional Formatting is used to fill in blank cells with red so that they are easily identifiable. This left 125 players overall.

Again, for the scope of this project and getting a general overview without extraneous hassle, this will give an adequate snapshot of the relationships between salary and these other factors.

Even though there seems to be a significant relationship between the two, overall, this is not very useful for practical interpretation, as 95.95% of variation in salary is explained by other variables other than games played.

						<b>All WNBA Simple Linear Regressions Overall Intuitive Interpretation:</b>
					</p>
					<p>
						Overall, the league's players' salaries tend to have a somewhat positive relationship with games played, minutes per game, and points per game. Those players who contribute the most to their team's success also tend to have the highest salaries. While the relationships are statistically significant, the strength of their correlations tend to be quite weak (with 2021's minutes per game and points per game having the strongest correlations) and do not seem to have much practical value.

						<h4>MULTIPLE LINEAR REGRESSIONS:</h4>
					</header>
					<p>
						To identify which game statistics are better predictors of salary, a correlation matrix between all the variables is created, and then multiple linear regression is run.
					</p>
				

					<header class="major">
						<h5>1. Correlation Matrix:</h5>
					</header>
					<p>
						A correlation matrix is created to show the linear correlation between each pair of variables and to identify any multi-collinearity issues. The independent variables (game statistics) should have low correlations with each other and a high correlation with the dependent variable (salary). The correlation matrix is once again made using the Correlation option in the Data Analysis ToolPak.

						</a>
					</p>
					<p>
						Looking at all WNBA players has a similar pattern as looking at just the veterans: the game stats do not have particularly high correlation with salary, with Points Per Game continuing to be the highest at 0.385. Minutes Per Game and Points Per Game also continue to have a high correlation with each other due to taking these statistics as constant both years, so Minutes Per Game will be dropped prior to running the regression as it has the lowest correlation with salary.

						</a>
					</p>
					<p>
						Just like with the veterans, Minutes Per Game and Points Per Game have as stronger correlation with salary in 2021, compared to 2020. Games Played continues to have a low correlation with salary but the correlation does increase a bit. Minutes Per Game and Points Per Game continue to have a high correlation with each other—Minutes Per Game is redundant and will be dropped again.

						Similarly to the veterans, overall WNBA salary seems to have a weak positive relationship with points made per game. Those who score more tend to also have higher salaries.

						&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of course, there are multiple factors contributing to salary: the amount of variation in salary explained by the variation in Points Per Game is about 18.3% in 2020 and about 44% in 2021. </br>

						<h3><u>Discussion</u></h3>
					</header>
					<p>
						This exploration looked at the salaries of WNBA players, and at the relationships between salaries and three game statistics (Games Played, Minutes Per Game, and Points Per Game). More granular exploration was also done to see the differences between veterans (5/+ years experience in the WNBA) and the entirety of players in the WNBA.
					</p>
					<p>
						In 2020, median salary was $118,510 for veterans and $88,850 for all WNBA players. In 2021, median salary was $167,500 for veterans and $110,00 for all WNBA players. As one would expect, veterans have a higher median salary than the general WNBA due to them having more experience and, therefore, more of them getting paid on the higher range of salaries. With increases in team budgets afforded to the WNBA league in 2021, median salaries increased between 2020 and 2021—showing that more players were getting higher salaries (as opposed to only veterans or a few star players getting salary increases).
					</p>
					<p>
						Veterans tend to have a stronger relationship between their salaries and their game statistics than the general WNBA. In 2021, the percent of variation in salary that is explained by variation in Minutes Per Game was 33.6% for the veterans and 23.02% in the general WNBA. In 2021, the percent of variation in salary that is explained by variation in Points Per Game was 44% for veterans and 23.2% in the general WNBA. However, correlation does not equal causation, and there could be a lot of different reasons why there are relationships between salary and the various game stats. For the veterans, it could be that veterans tend to have the most experience so they get the highest salaries while also playing the most time and scoring the most points—the relationship between salary and these stats are tighter because those contributing the most for the longest amount of time get compensated for that effort. The relationship between salary and the game stats might be weaker in the general WNBA players group because there is such a spread of who gets to play (limited playing time with only five players on the court at once), how well they perform when they actually play (if they are brought in from the bench, are they consistent enough in their performance to have their skills accurately portrayed?), and the base salaries they can get. Due to salary budgets, players can not get up to the supermax salaries veterans can receive until they reach a certain number of years played; superstar new players who are putting in the most on the stats sheets might not be able to be properly compensated for their efforts the way veteran players can already be. 2021 allowed for higher team budgets and increased individual player salaries, so the relationships with salary probably were closer compared to 2020 because teams were allowed to more equitably distribute salaries to those who contributed more.
					</p>
					<p>
						When looking at what game statistics are better predictors of salary, Points Per Game seems to be the best out of the three that were looked at for both the entire WNBA and veterans only. Points production tends to be associated with the bigger driver in salary amounts—a player may play multiple games and play more minutes, but they need to be able to convert that into points. Of course, this is just one facet of the game and players who do not necessarily score the most points but are defensive specialists or contribute in other ways can also have a salary reflecting that effort. A possible follow up to this project would be to look at more game statistics.
